# Parameter settings

In this chapter I will describe the various parameter settings we have explored:
which are the possible decisions, which ones we have set and which were looked at,
why. This should be preceded by an explanation of the workflow itself.

(Maybe I can export from what I had already written?)

Maybe I can add the medoids discussion here?
