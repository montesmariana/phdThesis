# NephoVis

In this chapter we will learn how to use the visualization tool to explore
and compare token-level vector space models.

As of this moment, the tool can be found at a
[Github Page](https://montesmariana.github.io/NephoVis), that is,
a [Github repository](https://github.com/montesmariana/NephoVis) that can be rendered
as a static website. It obtains its data from a [submodule](https://github.com/montesmariana/tokenclouds);
an interested user could clone the repository and just modify the path to the data.

<!-- TODO Decide on a data format -->

The code for the visualization is written in Javascript, making heavy use of the
[D3.js](https://d3.js) library, which was designed for beautiful web-based
**d**ata-**d**riven visualization. While it is known of its steep learning curve,
it can be useful to think of it in terms of R's vectorized approach: it links
DOM elements to arrays and manipulates them based on the items' properties.

The main rationale and framework for this visualization tool was developed by
Thomas Wielfaert [@wielfaert_visual_2019]; the code can be found
[here](https://github.com/tokenclouds/tokenclouds.github.io/LeTok/)
<!-- TODO add his dissertation? -->
The current implementation would not exist without this foundational setup. However,
a number of the available features were added later.

The description of the tool will follow the expected workflow of an user, starting
in [Level 1](#level_1), moving on to [Level 2](#level_2) and diving deeper in
[Level 3](#level_3). Finally, Section \@ref(wishlist) goes into the Beta features
that require better development and testing, as well as ideas that we might want to
implement in the future. In any case, it must be noted that from July 2019 to
`r Sys.Date()` the user and developer have been the same person, with occasional,
valuable input from other members of the Nephological Semantics project. The
project could certainly benefit from a wider input of suggestions.

<!-- NOTE we might actually want to dedicate a section to the shared features of levels 2 and 3 -->
