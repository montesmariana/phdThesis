The research described in this dissertation is part of the Nephological Semantics^[https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl/projects/current/nephological-semantics] research project at the `r sc("qlvl")` research group in KU Leuven,
which aims to develop tools for large-scale corpus-based semantic analysis.
A core aspect of the project involves representing semantic structure with distributional models,
a computational tool that currently requires a deeper understanding of its inner workings
and how its results relate to cognitive theories of meaning. 

Context-counting distributional models represent words[^word] as vectors of co-occurrence frequencies in a multidimensional space
[@turney.pantel_2010; @lenci_2018]. Basically, a word is represented by
its association strength to other words.
They can be generated at both type and token level [@heylen.etal_2012; @heylen.etal_2015; @depascale_2019].
At type level, two words are represented as more similar if they are attracted to the same
contextual features (e.g. other words) and repelled by the same contextual features. This should
allow us to identify semantic fields and other relationships between words, but collapses the full
range of contexts of each word into one representation.
At token level, instead, we look at individual occurrences and define them as more similar if
the words in their contexts are attracted to and repelled by the same contextual features.
This way we should be able to map the internal variation of the behaviour of individual words,
i.e. their semasiological structure.

Within the larger Nephological Semantics project, this particular work package is dedicated
to the understanding of token-level distributional models as a tool
for the study of polysemy. Concretely, I explored a number of parameter settings for the models
(i.e. ways of defining the context used to represent each token) and their impact on the
resulting representation, by means of visual analytics.
Manually annotated sense tags were used as a heuristic, but without
considering them a golden standard. Instead, the aim was to map parameter settings to various
semantic phenomena coded in the annotations, such as
meaning granularity (e.g. distinguishing homonyms and senses within the homonyms).
The distributional models, which take the form of large matrices,
can be reduced to two dimensions via different methods,
such as t-`r sc("sne")` [@Rtsne2008; @Rtsne2014].
These coordinates can then be mapped onto a scatterplot, resulting in a variety of
shapes, which we call *clouds*.

The workflow was applied to a set of 32 Dutch nouns, verbs and adjectives exhibiting
a range of semantic phenomena. For each of them, 240-320 concordance lines were extracted
from a corpus of Dutch and Flemish newspapers,
annotated and modelled. The combination of parameter settings, some of which included syntactic
information, resulted in 200-212 different models per lemma. The models were clustered with Partition
Around Medoids [@kaufman.rousseeuw_1990; @R-cluster] so that a manageable, representative set could be explored
in more depth, in particular visualizing their t-`r sc("sne")` representations.

The contributions of this dissertation are twofold. On the one hand, the exploration of
the possibilities and limits of distributional models to lexicological research resulted in
warnings, suggestions and guidelines for practical studies. In other words, it offers
an assessment and interpretation of distributional models from the perspective of descriptive linguistics.
On the other hand, it presents a visualization tool designed for the exploration of
token-level distributional models from such a perspective [@montes.qlvl_2021a]. Its interactive quality makes
it challenging to describe it adequately in a printed text, so I would strongly
recommend visiting it in its virtual home^[https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis/] and explore it.

[^word]: The term *word* is used very loosely here to encompass different possible definitions.
