# Introduction {-}

Here I'm starting the first draft ever of my PhD dissertation.
There are reports scattered all over the place, but here I will try to write things already
thinking of a Final Product. I need a layout (briefly discussed a week ago) and
I will slowly start building the final text.

The original title (in any case, the title of my project) was
*Methodological triangulation in corpus-based distributional semantics*,
which indicates I'm going to compare several corpus-based methods.

I was going to do some behavioral profiles, but that might prove a bit tough right now.
A bit too much.
In any case, I did compare manual annotation with token-vector models.

What I really did do was develop the visualization,
based on [Thomas Wielfaert's original code](https://github.com/tokenclouds/tokenclouds.github.io),
analyze the parameter settings in multiple ways,
checking different combinations and exploring different avenues,
and lead, check, study and compare manual annotation of 33 lemmas.

That is what I'm going to write about.
