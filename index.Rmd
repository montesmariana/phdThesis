# Introduction {-}

Here I'm starting the first draft ever of my PhD dissertation.
There are reports scattered all over the place, but here I will try to write things already
thinking of a Final Product. I need a layout (briefly discussed at the end of February) and
I will slowly start building the final text.

The original title (in any case, the title of my project) was
*Methodological triangulation in corpus-based distributional semantics*,
but the triangulation part was lost somewhere along the way.

What I really did do was develop the visualization,
based on [Thomas Wielfaert's original code](https://github.com/tokenclouds/tokenclouds.github.io),
analyze the parameter settings in multiple ways,
checking different combinations and exploring different avenues,
and lead, check, study and compare manual annotation of 32 lemmas.

That is what I'm going to write about.
