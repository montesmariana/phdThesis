# The nature of clouds

Clouds don't necessarily show senses
:    but usage patterns --the senses are well distinguished
insofar they match those usage patterns. But we could have one usage pattern for multiple
senses, multiple usage patterns for one sense, and, more importantly, different degrees
of definition of each usage pattern.

It is not a matter of frequency
:    we can have infrequent senses/patterns that are nonetheless strong enough to form
a clear group; and
:    extremely frequent senses can also be grouped separately, they don't necessarily
absorb the minor senses/patterns, if their pattern is characteristic enough.
