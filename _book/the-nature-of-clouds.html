</h2>
<p>Clouds come in many shapes. Like the cotton-like masses of droplets we see in our skies, the clusters of word occurrences generated by token-level distributional models may take different forms, depending on their density, their size and their distinctiveness. “Meaning is use,” “Differences in usage correlate with differences in meaning,” “You shall know a word by the company it keeps” and other such catchy slogans sound intuitively accurate, but they hide a wealth of complexity and variation. Like meaning, context is far from orderly, and a myriad of words with different characteristics interact to generate the variation we see in these clouds.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will try to make sense of the nephological topology, i.e. the variety of shapes that these clouds may take. For this purpose, we will classify HDBSCAN clusters mapped to t-SNE representations in a way that can help us understand what we see when we see a cloud. The starting point is the shape that a researcher sees in the scatterplot, which will be visually mapped to meteorological cloud types and further described in technical terms.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#theo2-rationale">8.2</a> we will discuss the rationale behind this particular classification and the tools used to operationalise these decisions. Section <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#cloud-patterns">8.3</a> will explore the technicalities that characterise the different types of clouds and their distribution across the lemmas. A more detailed description of each cloud type and their technical interpretations follows in Section <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#cloud-types">8.4</a>, and finally we summarise the chapter in Section <a href="#theo2-summary"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Rationale of the classification<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theo2-rationale"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In this document I will present the cloud classification, with <em>cloud</em> referring to an HDBSCAN cluster of a token-level vector space. As we will see below, we might have models with only one type of cloud, but typically they will have more than one. For each type, we will look at both a technical and a semantic interpretations, so that a future intrepid cloud spotter might know what to do or not to do with a given encounter. Types of clouds will be illustrated both with a picture of an actual cloud, taken from Wikimedia, and with plots from the vector spaces.</p>
<p>Understanding the complexity of the relationship between context words and clouds (or lack thereof) is crucial for the technical and semantic interpretations of all the clouds.</p>
<p>One thing to take into account is that the distances between tokens result from a complex interplay of features of their context words, but then both clustering and visualization add a layer of interpretation meant to find patterns of similar tokens that are different to the other tokens. Sometimes those patterns are easy to find, which leads to very nice, interpretable clusters (Cumulus, mostly); sometimes they are very hard to find, resulting in lots of noise and/or less defined clusters.</p>
<p>The factors that interact to produce a group of similar tokens include frequency, whether the context words co-occur or not, and their type-level similarity.</p>
<p>Clouds can be dominated by one context word that co-occurs with all the tokens in the cluster and does not occur outside the cluster. This perfect precision and recall of a context word for a cluster is not so common, but slightly perfect situations are quite common.</p>
<p>The cluster could instead be characterized by a group of context words that are similar at the type-level. They can be paradigmatic alternatives of each other or syntagmatic co-occurrences. The more similar two paradigmatic alternatives are at the type-level, the more they approximate one unique context word with their combined frequencies. In that sense, a cluster of 20 tokens co-occurring with the same context word may look the same as a cluster of 20 tokens co-occurring with 20 very similar context words.</p>
<p>Syntagmatic co-occurrences may enhance the similarity if their vectors are similar, or may be cause for splits when they are different. For example, 20 tokens co-occurring with the same context word, of which 10 occur with a very different context word and 10 don’t, will probably be split in two clusters. This is hard interpret from mere recall and precision values of a single cluster, since a key aspect is the complementarity between clusters, i.e. both clusters in this example would share a representative word and be distinguished by whether they also include the other representative word or not.</p>
<p>That covers the paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationship between context words and their corresponding similarity at type-level. However, whether they will actually create different clusters, either at HDBSCAN or, visually, on t-SNE, also depends on the frequency with which they co-occur and on the characteristics of the other context words. The <em>relative</em> frequencies and similarities plays a strong role in actually generating patterns. It’s very complicated and I don’t really know how to model it yet, but what I do know is that, whenever we interpret these clusters, technically or semantically, <strong>all these things play a role</strong>. Most often, a cluster dominated by one context word or dominated by three very similar context words are visually indistinguishable; whether two clusters have different main context words or they share one context word while they don’t share another is also visually indistinguishable.</p>
<p>I’ve divided the clouds in five categories plus a cross-cutting category. The classification is based on a combination of t-SNE visualization (perplexity 30) and HDBSCAN (minPts = 8) and it would probably be different if other visualization techniques or clustering algorithms are used.</p>
<p>The goal is to offer some guidelines on how (not) to interpret clouds, based on what they look like when we superimpose the HDBSCAN clustering to the t-SNE visualization (both based on the log-transformed cosine distances). A small number of steps based on formal criteria approximates the shape-based classification in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>The main categories, which I will describe in more detail below, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cumulus</strong>: the most defined clouds;</li>
<li>
<strong>Stratocumulus</strong>: a slightly looser definition of still decent clouds;</li>
<li>
<strong>Cirrus</strong>: the weakest, smallest, less defined clouds;</li>
<li>
<strong>Cumulonimbus</strong>: massive clouds;</li>
<li>
<strong>Cirrostratus</strong>: the HDBSCAN noise (so, not a cluster).</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps to classify the clouds rely on the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the cluster is noise (since it is automatically named Cirrostratus);</li>
<li>the proportion of modelled tokens it covers;</li>
<li>the kNN (<span class="math inline">\(k=8\)</span>) and SIL values (from <code>semvar</code>) using all the clusters, including noise, as classes on an euclidean distance matrix based on the t-SNE solution<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Because I’m trying to reflect the match between HDBSCAN and t-SNE.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a>;</li>
<li>the mean pairwise distance between tokens of that cluster <code>mean distance</code>;</li>
<li>the proportion of tokens in the cluster with an <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> value lower than the minimum <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> value for noise tokens, <code>below_noise</code><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;The idea is that a cluster where most tokens are closer to each other than any pair of noise tokens stands out; or that a model where noise tokens have such deep &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(eps\)&lt;/span&gt; that clusters have similar values is actually quite uniform.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the steps are as follows; each step works on the remaining clusters after applying the previous steps.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Take all noise clusters, even in models with 100% noise. These are Cirrostratus.</li>
<li>Take the clusters covering 50% of the tokens or more. These are Cumulonimbus.</li>
<li>Take the clusters with kNN <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.75, SIL <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.5, <code>mean distance</code> <span class="math inline">\(\le\)</span> 0.5 and either <code>below_noise</code> <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.9 or in models with less than 10% noise. These are Cumulus.</li>
<li>Take the clusters covering less than 10% of the modelled tokens, either in models with at least 75% noise or if kNN &lt; 0.7. These are Cirrus.</li>
<li>Take the clusters with kNN <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.7, SIL <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.5 <em>or</em> mean distance <span class="math inline">\(\le\)</span> 0.2, as long as either <code>below_noise</code> &gt; 0.5 or no more than 10% of the modelled tokens are noise. These are Stratocumulus.</li>
<li>The remaining clusters are considered Cirrus.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the category of Hail groups the clusters with at least 8 identical tokens; these can belong to any of the other classes.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Patterns across types of clouds<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cloud-patterns"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<!-- NOTE Add: plots represent clusters in medoids, but the same patterns are shown across all models -->
<p>Beyond the features used as formal criteria to define the types of clouds, we can find patterns across other relevant features, which are shown in the following figures for the clusters in the medoids. For the same data across all models (which is comparable, just more cluttered), see the corresponding figures in the Appendix below.</p>
<p>For each cluster and the context words co-occurring with its tokens, we calculated the precision and recall of each of these context words. Based on these values, we obtained an (unweighted) F-score of each context word with each cluster.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:fscorePmi">8.1</a> shows the relationship between the highest F-score among the context words co-occurring with at least two tokens in a cluster and the PPMI value of that context word with the corresponding target based on a symmetric window of 4 words to either side. The cloud classification is mapped to the colour of the clusters and the fill of the marginal boxplots.</p>
<p>We can see that Cirrostratus clusters (noise) tend to have low F-score context words, and these tend to have very low PPMI values with the targets. Cumulus clusters, on the other side, have the highest F-scores, i.e. they tend to be dominated by one context word, and these context words tend to have high PPMI. Cirrus and Cumulonimbus clouds have lower values than Cumulus clouds, while Stratocumulus spans in between.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:cwFreq">8.2</a> shows the relationship between the type/token ratio of context words within a cluster (higher values indicate many different context words; lower values indicate fewer, more frequent context words) and the mean number of context words per token in that cluster. Instead of color-coding with the five cloud categories, which have rather similar distributions, we look at whether the cloud is an Altocumulus. Each point represents a cluster in a medoid.</p>
<p>It is only a minority of the clouds, but it is clear that both the ratio and the number of context words per token play a role, with lower values for the Altocumulus clouds.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:ttFscore">8.3</a> plots the type/token ratio of context words against the highest F-score among said context words, and maps the cloud classification to colors.</p>
<p>Both Cirrus and Cirrustratus tend to have a higher type/token ratio than the rest; as we saw in Table <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#tab:cloudFreqsMed">8.1</a>, fewer of them are Altocumulus. In general, the more different context words we find in the cluster, the lower the F-score, but there is a really wide range of variation. In any case, each type of cloud has a different profile in this sense: Cirrostratus has higher type/token ratios and lower F-scores, while the case of Cumulus is the opposite; Stratocumulus and Cumulonimbus have similar type/token ratios to Cumulus but lower or much lower F-scores, and Cirrus type/token ratios comparable to Cirrostratus but much higher F-scores.</p>

<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:epsplotM) looks at the relationship between the minimum and maximum eps value within each cluster, coloured by type of cloud. The lower the eps value, the earlier the points were clustered in HDBSCAN; clusters in the top-right corner (mostly Cirrostratus) are flat and late to cluster (indeed, they are noise), while clusters in the bottom-left corner are flat and earlier to cluster, and those in the top-left corner are much longer in the HDBSCAN tree. Each point represents a cluster in a medoid; for data across all models, see Figure \@ref(fig:epsplotA). -->
<!-- Beyond the obvious note that Cirrostratus clusters tend to have high eps values, we can make a few other observations. First, Cumulonimbus clouds tend to be long: their minimum value tend to be low, and the maximum tends to be high. Second, Cumulus clouds tend to have slightly lower maximum values and Cirrus tend to have higher minimum values, which is to be expected given the requirements regarding eps. This is easily mapped to meteorological altitude, as described in Section \@ref(altitude). -->
<!-- NOTE rethink whether it's a good idea to plot eps like this -->
<p>Finally, Figure <a href="#fig:entplot"><strong>??</strong></a> shows the entropy<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Computed with &lt;code&gt;entropy::entropy()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> of clusters of different types in terms of the manually annotated senses senses, against the entropy across the whole model. On the one hand, we can see that clusters of all types can occur on any model regardless of their sense distribution. On the other, we can see that the different clusters do have very different entropy values. Cumulus clouds are the most homogeneous, while the Cumulonimbus clouds tend to be as heterogeneous as Cirrostratus (noise) —they might even have higher entropy than their models as a whole. Cumulus clouds in particular, but sometimes also Stratocumulus and maybe Cirrus, may be completely homogeneous regardless of the sense composition of the model itself, but they can also have higher entropy. Stratocumulus clouds tend to have slightly lower entropy than Cirrus clouds even though they also tend to be larger.</p>

<!-- The metaphorical mapping from these visually represented HDBSCAN clusters to clouds is supported by two main characteristics, and in principle I wouldn't extend them any further (we might, playfully, but I won't expand on that). On the one hand, as the images in the respective sections show, we have a visual mapping, which should be helpful at least for those of us who don't know much about clouds to begin with. From this reductive, naive perspective, both the photographs and the plots evoke comparable images of discreteness, size and density. On the other hand, a more relevant characteristic of meteorological clouds can be mapped to the HDBSCAN clouds: the altitude. In an HDBSCAN result, points are characterized by an $eps$ value, which roughly indicates at which point of the algorithm it was grouped with another point (is that correct? I don't understand this fully, I will read more to make a better description), and the condensed tree representation shows points with higher eps on the top and those with lower eps to the bottom. The lower the eps, the denser the area around those points. Typically, noise tokens are going to have higher eps, and denser clusters are going to have lower eps. -->
<!-- This can be mapped to the altitude of the clouds, as shown in \@ref(fig:cloudtypes) (to compare, roughly, with the data in Figure \@ref(fig:epsplotM)). -->
<p>Cirrostratus and Cirrus are at the highest altitudes, which matches their tendency to have higher <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> values. In absolute <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> values, Cirrus clouds can be low, but (i) they are typically higher than Cumulus and Stratocumulus, (ii) their maximum value is typically higher as well and (iii) by definition they may have a substantial proportion of their points higher than the lowest Cirrostratus. The relative altitude between Cirrus and Cirrostratus is not perfectly mapped to <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span>: here, the difference lies mostly in the small, disperse visual shape of the Cirrus clouds against the more uniform, large outline of Cirrostratus.</p>
<p>Cumulus and Stratocumulus are at the lowest altitudes, which maps to their tendencies to have lower minimum and maximum eps values. Again, the difference between them is defined in terms of shape: Cumulus are normally more compact and defined.</p>
<p>Finally, Cumulonimbus (formerly Mammatus) are, in the meteorological sense, massive and towering. This maps to both the visual and <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> aspects: first, it covers a large proportion of the plot and visually dominates the model; second, it tends to cover a wide range of values. Figure <a href="#fig:epsplotM"><strong>??</strong></a> already shows that its maximum values are larger than for other types of clouds, except for Cirrostratus, while the minimum values are lower and more diverse. This is more clearly explained in terms of the range: the difference between the minimum and maximum <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> within a cluster. Across all the clouds (not just in medoids), the minimum <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> range in a Cumulonimbus clouds is
0.65 and the maximum is
4.48;
75% percent of these clouds have a range of 1.4 or more.
In contrast, considering all the other clouds (even Cirrostratus), the <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> ranges span between 0 (i.e. all points have the same <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span>) and 4.03, and 75% of these clouds have a range of 1.27 or less. In other words, these are massive, towering clouds.</p>

<p>There are more models with Cirrus clouds than with Cumulus clouds, but we can also see an inverse correlation between the proportion of models of a lemma that exhibit Cumulus clouds and the proportion that includes Cirrus clouds.</p>
<p>In the semantic interpretation, we will look at lemmas with particular tendencies, in terms of the proportion of models that have at least one cluster of a given type. I selected the most significant cases based on the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test: marked preference is understood as a residual above 2 or below -2.</p>

<li><p>Marked preference for Cumulus and against Cirrus: <em>heffen</em>, <em>hachelijk</em>, and <em>schaal</em>. Of these, <em>heffen</em> also has a marked preference for Stratocumulus.</p></li>
<li><p>Marked preference for Cumulus and against Cirrus, but also against Stratocumulus: <em>gemeen</em>, also the one with most Cumulonimbus clouds, and <em>stof</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Marked preference for Stratocumulus and against Cirrus, but only slightly for Cumulus: <em>heilzaam</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Marked preference for Cirrus and against both Cumulus and Stratocumulus: <em>geestig</em>, <em>gekleurd</em> and <em>hoekig</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Marked preference for Cirrus and against Cumulus but only slightly for Stratocumulus: <em>haten</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Highest preference for Cumulonimbus: <em>gemeen</em> again, but also <em>stof</em> and <em>schaal</em> (with residuals above 5; a few more have residuals above 2).</p></li>

<p>The Cumulus clouds are those that look the best. They feel satisfying.
In Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:cumulus">8.6</a>, they are the green, blue, red and pink clouds of the plot; the rest are Stratocumulus.</p>

<p>They are defined by a number of different measures with strict values, after excluding Cirrostratus and Cumulonimbus. First, the clusters need to have both kNN <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.75 and SIL <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.5 for the t-SNE solutions, that is, based on the euclidean distances between tokens on the 2D mapping returned by t-SNE. The kNN value for a token indicates the proportion of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> nearest neighbours (in this case with <span class="math inline">\(k = 8\)</span>) that belongs to the same class, i.e. the same HDBSCAN cluster. The higher it is, the lower the overlap between clusters. However, it is biased towards large clusters, which are likely to have many tokens with a kNN of 1. Therefore, we also require a SIL (silhouette) value of 0.5 or higher, which is decently high for these results and hard to achieve in large clusters.</p>
<p>Next to the <code>semvar</code> measures, we also require the mean pairwise cosine distance between the tokens to be 0.5 or lower, to favour more compact clusters. The final requirement makes sure that the cloud stands out against the noise. One of the ways it can achieve this is by having an <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> lower than the minimum noise <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> in at least 90% of the tokens; however, in models without any noise or with very little, noise <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> values might be particularly high (or, as it is calculated, the <code>below_noise</code> value is always equal to 0), so this threshold is not applied in models with less than 10% noise.</p>
<p>Most of these clouds are characterized by one context word with high precision and recall for the cluster. Specifically, the maximum F-score of a context word for these clusters is significantly higher than for any other type of cloud: 75% of these clusters have a context word with an F-score of
0.72 or higher, while in 75% of the rest of the clouds the context word with highest Fscore is not higher than 0.719. These top context words also tend to have high PPMI, but some may even have negative PMI.</p>
<!-- If a lemma has Cumulus clouds in multiple medoids, they are likely to be characterized by the same context word. In lemmas where many medoids have many such clusters, we are bound to found Stratocumulus around them that look very similar, as a "strong" form of Stratocumulus. -->
<!-- On the other hand, a few lemmas may have only one model with one or at most two Cumulus clouds. That is the case of dependency-based models of *grijs*, *haten* and *hoop* and a `FOC-POS:lex + FOC-WIN:5 + PPMI:selection` models of *goedkoop*, as well as a `FOC-POS:all + FOC-WIN:10 + PPMI:weight` model of *diskwalificeren*, in which the Cumulus clustered is dominated by the co-occurrence of *Schumacher* (and *Ferrari*, and a few similar context words). -->
<p>The Cumulus clouds typically look very nice and tight and indicate very strong collocational patterns, but that does not mean that these are idiomatic expressions or that two Cumulus clouds in the same model are going to have different meanings.
We’ll look at possible interpretations by inspecting some lemmas with the strongest preference for Cumulus clouds and against Cirrus: <em>schaal</em>, <em>stof</em>, <em>hachelijk</em>. <em>gemeen</em> and <em>heffen</em> also have a strong preference of Cumulus at the expenses of Cirrus. The former also rejects Stratocumulus and prefers Cumulonimbus, so it was already (briefly) described in section <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#cumulonimbus">8.4.4</a>; the latter has a strong preference for Stratocumulus, so it will be discussed in section <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#stratocumulus">8.4.2</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>schaal</em>, most of the Cumulus clouds are either represented by <em>Richter</em>/<em>kracht</em> (see examples (42) and (33)) or by <em>gewicht</em>, as shown in (43). These are examples of idiomatic expressions, where a fixed expression with a clear meaning beyond the componential combination of its elements can be identified. That is also the case of <em>stof doen opwaaien</em> and <em>de grootste gemene deler</em> (see (30) and (31)), next to other idiomatic expressions: they tend to be represented as Cumulus clouds. However, these idiomatic expressions do not necessarily include the target, e.g. <em>in ere</em> in (29). In addition, Cumulus clouds do not necessarily imply idiomatic expressions in this sense, as we can see from the rest of our examples.</p>
<ol start="5" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">

</ol>
<p>The typical Cumulus clouds for <em>stof</em> are either the ones for the idiomatic expression <em>stof doen opwaaien</em> or frequent pairs of <em>stof</em> and adjectives characteristic of its ‘substance’ sense, such as <em>gevaarlijk</em>, <em>giftig</em> and <em>chemisch</em>, exemplified in (6), (7) and (8). At type level, these three context words are quite similar to each other, but even then their frequencies seem to warrant separate clusters. They reveal different aspects of dangerous substances, but we wouldn’t say that they match different senses of <em>stof</em>. In any case, the clusters represented by these context words are just as likely to be Stratocumulus, while those represented by <em>opwaaien</em> are mostly Cumulus.</p>

</ol>
<p>An important point is that the models of <em>stof</em> detect mostly the idiomatic expression <em>stof doen opwaaien</em> and some strong collocates of the ‘substance’ sense, but other meaningful clusters are rare. In other models we have — mostly Cirrus — clouds represented by <em>discussie</em>, which is a good cue for the ‘topic’ sense, but otherwise the most representative context words are less helpful. This is quite unfortunate, because colour coding of the senses reveals that some models can be quite successful at pushing the senses to different sections in the t-SNE plot, if only almost conflating the literal ‘dust’ sense with the ‘fabric’ sense, and the rest of the idiomatic tokens with the ‘topic’ sense. However, the groups are not drastic enough to be found by HDBSCAN as well.</p>
<p>Another way in which Cumulus clusters can be formed is by complementary absence and presence of context words, which can be exemplified by some clusters of <em>hachelijk</em>. For this lemma, the context words responsible of most Cumulus clouds include <em>avontuur</em>, <em>onderneming</em>, — all indicative of the ‘potentially dangerous’ sense —, <em>moment</em>, and <em>positie</em> — all indicative of the ‘critical’ sense —, but also <em>bevrijden</em> and <em>brandweer</em>, which are typical of Belgian contexts. These are exemplified in (52) through (14).</p>

</ol>
<p>Here we can see a combination of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations. On the one hand, <em>avontuur</em>, <em>onderneming</em> (or, less frequently, <em>zaak</em>), <em>moment</em>, and <em>positie</em> are paradigmatic alternatives for the slot of noun modified by the target. They are also quite unequivocal indicators of one or the other sense, even if the difference between the senses is rather a matter of [temporal/telic] construal. At type level, <em>situatie</em> (which tends to occur in Stratocumulus) and <em>positie</em> are very similar, and <em>onderneming</em> is sometimes quite similar to <em>situatie</em>, but for the rest they are quite different from each other. In all cases, the patterns seem frequent enough to warrant distinct clouds.</p>
<p>At the same time, examples (55), (13) and (14) indicate typical examples from distinct clusters that persist across models and are the result of syntagmatic relations. The tokens co-occurring with <em>positie</em> — but not those co-occurring with other context words — may also co-occur with <em>bevrijden</em> (and <em>uit</em>), and additionally they might also include <em>brandweer</em>. The three patterns, characterized by the presence or absence of <em>bevrijden</em> and <em>brandweer</em> next to <em>positie</em>, are frequent enough (about 9 tokens each) to form distinct clusters. An important point is that, while <em>brandweer</em> and <em>bevrijden</em> are relatively close at type-level, they are very far from <em>positie</em>, which makes the tokens that co-occur with <em>brandweer</em> and/or <em>bevrijden</em> very different from those who don’t. And yet, the three small <em>positie</em> clusters are closer to each other in the t-SNE clouds than to the <em>situatie</em> cluster.</p>
<p>This is an important example of how clusters are the result of a combination of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between the context words. The cluster illustrated by (55) is not only characterized by the presence of <em>positie</em> but also by the absence of <em>bevrijden</em> and <em>brandweer</em>. In addition, the fact that this pattern occurs with <em>positie</em> but not with the very similar <em>situatie</em>, and in Belgian tokens but not in Dutch ones, indicates a local pattern that emerges in the context of <em>hachelijk</em> even if it’s not significant in the global scheme of the full corpus.</p>

<p>The Stratocumulus clouds are quite decent, although sometimes they look almost as good as Cumulus clouds, while in other cases they are much less clear. In Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:stratocumulus">8.7</a>, all three clusters are Stratocumulus — indeed, they cover a rather wide range of respectable-looking clouds, with different sizes and degree of compactness.

<p>The definition of Stratocumulus clouds takes a number of different measures and applies less strict thresholds than for Cumulus clouds. First the Cirrostratus, Cumulonimbus and Cumulus must classified, and the smallest cloudsm either in noisy models or without high kNNm must be reserved for Cirrus. On the remaining clusters we apply two filters. First, they must either have kNN <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.7, SIL <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 0.5 or mean pairwise cosine distance <span class="math inline">\(\le\)</span> 0.2. In addition, either more than half the tokens have an <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> value below the minimum noise <span class="math inline">\(eps\)</span> value or the percentage of noise tokens in the model is lower than 10%.</p>
<p>Stratocumulus clouds are generally large: while 75% of either Cumulus or Cirrus have
28 tokens or fewer, half the Stratocumulus have 26 or more.
However, in comparison to Cirrus they tend to have lower type/token ratio of context words<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Either counting all context words in the cluster or just those that are enough to cover the tokens, in descending order of F-score.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> and higher F-score values of their representative context words. In addition, the mean cosine distance between the tokens tend to be comparable to that in Cirrus clusters, in spite of the difference in size; in other words, they are larger but more compact and more clearly defined.</p>
<p>While lemmas that prefer Cumulus clouds tend to avoid Cirrus clouds and vice versa, the relationship with Stratocumulus is not so straightforward. A preference for Cumulus tends to go hand in hand with a preference for Stratocumulus, but there are some reverse cases and even some in which both Cirrus and Stratocumulus are preferred to the disadvantage of Cumulus (<em>haten</em>) or the other way around (<em>gemeen</em> and <em>stof</em>).</p>
<p>If we discard the hope to map clusters to senses, but decide to just interpret them in terms of collocational patterns, Stratocumulus clouds group the transition step between the very firm patterns of the Cumulus clusters and the weaker ones in Cirrus clusters. Given that the same context word can represent clusters of different types in different models (see examples below), the proportion with which they go for one or the other may give us an indication of the strength of the pattern.</p>
<p>To illustrate the semantic interpretation for Stratocumulus clouds, we will look at two lemmas with strong preference towards this type: <em>heffen</em>, which also has a strong preference for Cumulus and against Cirrus, and <em>heilzaam</em>, which also strongly rejects Cirrus and slightly prefers Cumulus.</p>
<p>The most typical representative words in clusters of <em>heffen</em> are <em>belasting</em>, <em>tol</em> and <em>accijns</em> for the ‘to levy’ sense and <em>glas</em> and <em>hand</em> for the ‘to lift’ sense, as illustrated in examples (46) through (19). Together, these context words represent 86.3% of all the Stratocumulus clouds of <em>heffen</em> and 92.7% of all its Cumulus clusters, but with different tendencies.</p>
<ol start="15" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">

(<em>NA</em>, 1999-12-27, Art. 10)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First, <em>belasting</em> mostly represents Stratocumulus clouds (79.9%), because of its frequency and its tendency to bring some tokens with similar contexts under its wing. In contrast, Cumulus is preferred by
<em>accijns</em> (NA%),
<em>tol</em> (69.7%) and
<em>glas</em> (62.9%),
which tend to have both perfect precision and very high recall for their respective clusters. The first two are just frequent enough to merit their own clusters, but <em>glas</em> occurs around 30 times in the sample (against 40-50 for <em>belasting</em>).</p>
<p>Finally, <em>hand</em> represents Cumulus and Stratocumulus clusters equally (46.6% and 47.7% respectively); its frequency is slightly lower than <em>glas</em>, but its recall is substantially lower for its clusters. In fact, this is another example of combination of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships next to frequency and distinctiveness.
An algorithm that only captures the most relevant context word of a cluster will fail to find that the <em>hand</em> clusters also include tokens co-occurring with the paradigmatic alternatives <em>arm</em> and <em>vinger</em> (see examples (20) and (21)), whose type-level vectors are very similar. In addition, about half of the tokens in these clusters also co-occur with <em>hemel</em>, which is not a paradigmatic alternative of the body parts and, in a few models, may take the role of most representative context word. However, its effect is different from <em>brandweer</em> and <em>bevrijden</em> in the case of <em>hachelijk</em> because its type-level vector is close to that of the body parts. The internal consistency of these body-parts clusters, in terms of mean cosine distances, is lower than those of the other clusters — even the <em>belasting</em> clouds and even as a Cumulus — but it is clearly uniform enough to form one cluster.</p>

</ol>
<p>The models of <em>heffen</em> are particularly nice in that they tend to have quite defined Cumulus or Stratocumulus clusters with identifiable representative context words that, at the same time, are very good cues for the predefined sentences. But this is by no means something to take for granted, as the models of <em>heilzaam</em> show us.</p>
<p>The two senses of <em>heilzaam</em> correspond to literal ‘beneficial for the health, healthy’ and a metaphorical/broader ‘beneficial’ sense. Unfortunately, its most frequent context words and representatives of their clusters are not distinctive of any sense but occur equally with both of them. An interesting point is that these were also tagged as cues by the annotators, for both senses. These context words, illustrated in (<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-heilzaam/werking" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>heilzaam/werking?</strong></a>)</span>) through (26), are the nouns <em>werking</em>, <em>effect</em> and <em>invloed</em> and the verbs <em>werken</em> and <em>zijn</em>. Together, they cover 89.7% of all the Stratocumulus clouds of <em>heilzaam</em> and 91.5% of all its Cumulus clusters.</p>

<p>The most frequent context word, <em>werking</em>, forms Stratocumulus clouds
63.5% of the time, because, while both kNN and the mean cosine distance are good enough for Cumulus clouds, the SIL values are rather low; notably, within the medoids it tends to form Cirrus clouds instead.
In contrast, <em>invloed</em> prefers Cumulus
64% and <em>effect</em> represents both equally
(40.3% and 42.1%).
All three form Cirrus clouds 1 out of 10 times across all the clusters they form. At type-level, the three of them are usually very similar, especially <em>invloed</em> and <em>effect</em>, but clearly they are frequent enough to warrant separate clusters. <em>Werking</em> can also be seen close to <em>werken</em>.
The verbs, on the other hand, are less consistent, with <em>zijn</em> preferring both Stratocumulus and Cirrostratus (as expected, it is not such a strong cue), and <em>werken</em>, Cumulus and Cirrus, to about 40% each.</p>
<p>Like the clusters of <em>heffen</em>, the clusters of <em>heilzaam</em> tend to be characterized by one powerful context word, with a high PPMI with the target type (except for <em>zijn</em>), that overrides the influence of other co-occurring context word and their mutual similarity. Nonetheless, unlike the representative context words of <em>heffen</em>, those of <em>heilzaam</em> are not good cues for the predefined senses.</p>
<p>It is an empirical question how often the contexts grouped in HDBSCAN clusters are homogeneous in terms of particular semantic phenomena, but <em>heilzaam</em> shows that it is not something to take for granted. What is more, it illustrates how neither a high PPMI nor their selection as cues by human annotators guarantee that a context word distinguishes predefined senses.
When it comes to PPMI, it is understandable: the measure is meant to indicate how distinctive a context word is of the type as a whole, in comparison to other types. It does not take into account how distinctive it is of a group of occurrences against another group of occurrences of the same type.
When it comes to cueness annotation, however, we could have expected a more reliable selection, but apparently the salience of these context words is to high for the annotators to notice that it is not distinctive of the different senses.</p>

<p>The Cirrus clouds are typically small, disperse clusters. In Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:cirrus">8.8</a>, both clusters belong to this category. These are clusters in models with lots of noise and/or disperse clusters that don’t stand out without color coding.</p>

<p>They are defined as small clusters in noisy models or without kNN, next to the remainder of the clusters after defining Cirrostratus, Cumulonimbus, Cumulus and Stratocumulus.</p>
<p>Cirrus clouds are generally small, like Cumulus clouds: in a few cases they cover more than 100 points, but then the silhouette is too low and either the kNN or the percentage of tokens below noise is too low to be considered Stratocumulus. In any case, 75% of these clouds have 28 tokens or fewer.
In spite of their size, they have a high high type/token ratio of context words and a low top Fscore, even compared to larger Stratocumulus: they have less of a tendency to be represented by single powerful context words. They also tend to have a higher entropy, regardless of the entropy of the model and in spite of their smaller size.</p>
<p>As we saw before, context words that represent Stratocumulus clouds can also represent Cirrus clouds — they are not necessarily bad, useless clusters. But, by tendency, they are defined by weaker patterns, and when they are the dominant type of cloud in a lemma, they suggest a a rather uniform internal structure. In fact, there is a moderate but significant inverse correlation between the proportion of Cirrus clusters for a lemma and the median Fscore of their most representative context word.</p>
<p>To illustrate the semantic interpretation of Cirrus clouds, we will look at some lemmas that prefer them while avoiding Cumulus: <em>gekleurd</em>, <em>hoekig</em> and <em>geestig</em>, which also avoid Stratocumulus, and <em>haten</em>, which does prefer Stratocumulus. In addition, both <em>geestig</em> and <em>haten</em> tend to have noisy models.</p>
<p>These four lemmas, next to <em>hemels</em>, are the ones with a larger proportion of noise tokens in their models; in <em>geestig</em> in particular, 10% of the models are only Cirrostratus. They are also among the six lemmas with the lower mean number of clusters per model (as low as 2.415 for <em>geestig</em>, and up to 3.175 for <em>hoekig</em>).</p>

<p>The Cumulonimbus category (Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:cumulonimbus">8.9</a>) is the least frequent, but when it does occur, it dominates the plot. Almost all lemmas have at least one such medoid, and a few have two or up to four medoids dominated by Cumulonimbus clouds. Considering all models, <em>gemeen</em>, <em>stof</em> and <em>schaal</em> are the lemmas with a largest proportion of medoids with Cumulonimbus clouds, between a third and half the models.</p>
<p>Cumulonimbus clouds are minimally defined as clusters that cover at least 50% of the modelled tokens, including those discarded as noise. In practice, half of them cover at least 58.7% or more, reaching as much as 95.7%.
<!-- TODO: use code to get the numbers -->
Next to them, we typically have one more cluster (85.6% ignoring the noise);
occasionally we may have two (11.1%) or even up to 5.
They mostly co-occur with Cumulus clouds (0% of all these models have only Cumulus next to the Cumulonimbus; 54.8% have exactly one) but all combinations are attested.</p>

<p>This configuration results from a tight and/or small group of tokens that are very different from everything else. The “everything else” forms the Cumulonimbus cloud: large, normally disperse, and may seem to have inner structure captured by t-SNE but not by HDBSCAN. The small group, has a minimum of 8 tokens (the <code>minPts</code> argument for HDBSCAN) and mostly (75%) less than 30.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, we find that the small partner cloud is dominated by either one context word or a number of extremely similar context words that are very different from the rest. Some examples of dominant context words for the small partner cloud are <em>werpen</em> and <em>richten</em> in models of <em>blik</em> (examples (68) and (69)), <em>ere</em> in models of <em>herstellen</em>, as in (29), and the combination of <em>doen</em> and <em>opwaaien</em> in models of <em>stof</em>, as in (30).</p>

<p>Cases of groups of topically similar context words are football terms in models of <em>haken</em>
(e.g. the 5 context words with highest precision in one such cluster are <em>strafschop</em>, <em>strafschop_gebied</em>, <em>zet_om</em>, <em>penalty</em>, <em>doorgebroken</em>),
food in terms of <em>hemels</em>
(e.g. <em>gerecht</em>, <em>garnaal</em>, <em>groente</em>, <em>smaak</em>, <em>dressing</em>),
cars in terms of <em>grijs</em>
(e.g. <em>Mercedes</em>, <em>Opel</em>, <em>Ford</em>, <em>zie</em>, <em>steel</em>),
and proper names in models of <em>hoopvol</em>
(e.g. <em>aldus</em>, <em>Hecke</em>, <em>Rompaey</em>, <em>Coster</em>, <em>Winter</em>).</p>
<p>The rest of the tokens, i.e. the Cumulonimbus cloud, has no uniforming structure, but instead is defined against this stronger, small cloud. Cumulonimbus clouds are not huge clusters of similar tokens, but a mass of tokens that is not structured enough in opposition to the distinctive small cloud that is next to it. It may have some form of inner structure: in fact, sometimes the small partner does not stand out as much as its inner dense areas in the t-SNE visualization. We might find relevant context words for them, especially if they are tight enough to be also considered Altocumulus clouds. But the reason they are a cluster is not because the tokens are similar to each other, as much as because the tokens in the small partner are similar to each other and different from everything else. The mean distance between tokens in a Cumulonimbus cloud is typically very large, sometimes as large as within Cirrostratus (noise), and significantly larger than within other kinds of clusters (although the few examples of Cirrus and Stratocumulus co-occurring with Cumulonimbus also have large mean distances).</p>
<p>The small partner cloud(s) in models with Cumulonimbus indicate either a very strong collocation (often an idiomatic expression!) or a strong topical tendency, depending on the number of context words involved (see note at the beginning). However, the large cluster groups all the rest, obscuring the inner structure. Sometimes, the visualization shows clear dense areas within the large cluster.</p>
<p>The small cloud is typically found in other medoids of the same lemma as well; it is very informative, as it shows a rather reliable collocation, but might also be too powerful. While the small groups make sense, the Cumulonimbus itself hides variation that we might be interested in.</p>
<p>If the Cumulonimbus cloud makes any sense at all, it is by coincidence.
For example, two <em>huldigen</em> medoids have Cumulonimbus clouds, where the smaller partners (either as one Stratocumulus or as two Cumulus and one Stratocumulus) are characterized by the co-occurrences of <em>opvatting</em>, <em>standpunt</em> and <em>principe</em>, which are strong indicatives of the ‘to hold (an opinion)’ sense. This split matches our sense disambiguation, because all the remaining tokens, i.e. those of the ‘to pay homage’ sense of <em>huldigen</em>, are gathered in the Cumulonimbus cloud. However, that is just a side effect of the fact that the ‘to hold (an opinion)’ sense has a clear, coherent set of characteristic context words that set themselves apart from everything else, where “everything else” just happens to be a dictionary sense. In terms of type-level distances, for example, the mean distance between tokens of the same cluster is quite high for both Cumulonimbus and Stratocumulus clouds (much more than for Cumulus), and the maximum distance within the Cumulonimbus cloud is the highest, almost as much as the noise.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned before in Section <a href="#by-lemma"><strong>??</strong></a>, the lemmas with the strongest preference for Cumulonimbus clouds are <em>gemeen</em>, <em>stof</em>, and <em>schaal</em>, followed by <em>spot</em>. These lemmas tend to have some very strong context that separates a set of tokens from everything else regardless of the internal structure of the rest of the tokens or even the variety of context words co-occurring within the smaller cluster. These strong context words include <em>deler</em> for <em>gemeen</em> (example (31)) and <em>opwaaien</em> for <em>stof</em> (example (30)). In the case of <em>schaal</em>, in one of the medoids the context word is <em>Richter</em>, while in the other, it’s <em>kracht</em>, complemented by other earthquake-related context words (examples (42) and (33)); they both represent the same set of tokens, but <em>Richter</em> has the part-of-speech name and is therefore excluded from <code>FOC-POS:lex</code> models. In both cases, this smaller cloud covers the ‘range of values’ sense of scale, leaving the rest of the senses of either homonym in the same Cumulonimbus cluster. Crucially, the characteristic context words are not particularly representative of the sense, which could, in theory, include instances of <em>de schaal van Celsius</em>, for example. Instead, this sense is almost exclusively found in the context of earthquakes, in the expression <em>de schaal van Richter</em>. Finally, in <em>spot</em> models we also find two possible (sets) of context words representing the small cloud against Cumulonimbus clusters. On the one hand, we have <em>drijven</em> (example (34)), which is a good indicator of the ‘ridicule’ sense, is itself quite frequent and makes for large clouds contrasting the Cumulonimbus clusters. On the other, we have <em>1ste</em> and two more almost identical context words that are excluded by <code>FOC-POS:lex</code> models and occur in a very particular context that seems to be a headline (see (35)).</p>

</ol>
<p>In conclusion, Cumulonimbus clouds occur in lemmas where one or a few similar context words may group togethers very closely and far away from the rest, making the differences between the rest of the tokens pale in comparison to the difference with the smaller group. The small cloud is typically but not necessarily a Cumulus, and the large one that gathers the “rest” category is the Cumulonimbus, which does not have a grouping characteristic but is instead built in opposition to the more powerful one.</p>
<p>Lemmas that barely have any Cumulonimbus clouds, such as <em>herroepen</em>, <em>hoekig</em>, <em>diskwalificeren</em> and <em>horde</em>, for which at most 5% of the models have Cumulonimbus clouds, lack such a strong pattern and have, instead, groups with similar frequencies and mutual differences.</p>

<p>We will first, briefly, mention the Cirrostratus type (Figure <a href="the-nature-of-clouds.html#fig:cirrostratus">8.10</a>), i.e. the noise according to HDBSCAN. It lies in the background of (almost) all our clouds and constitutes 100% of two of our medoids. Considering the entirety of our models, 146 (0%) of them are fully Cirrostratus clouds.
<!-- TODO how many of all our clouds are pure noise? -->
<!-- Are their medoids also noise? Do pure noise medoids represent non-noisy clouds? -->
<!-- Are there pure-noise models in lemmas without pure-noise medoids? -->
<!-- Is there any tendency for a shape in models represented by a pure-noise medoid (or the other way around)? --></p>
<p>It might be interesting to cluster the subset of tokens that make up these clouds, at least for some lemmas, but that is not pursued in these studies. We will mostly ignore these clouds, but they are always present and affect how other clouds are defined.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the configurations (and breaking the metaphor of cloud shapes), Altocumulus clouds occur across all classifications. In Figure <a href="#fig:altocumulus"><strong>??</strong></a>, both the clouds are Altocumulus: the small, orange one is a Cumulus and the large light blue one, a Cumulonimbus. These are clusters with at least 8 (<span class="math inline">\(minPts\)</span>) identical tokens, defined as having a cosine distance lower than 10^{-6}.</p>
<p>For this reason, I might rename them with something that is not the shape of a cloud. To avoid “bubbles,” maybe “hail” or “snow.” In fact, in relative numbers the cloud type that occurs in this shape the most is Cumulonimbus, which is a storm cloud! Followed by Cumulus and Stratocumulus, which have higher absolute frequencies, but in relative frequencies less than 10% are “Altocumulus/Hail.”</p>
<p>5% of the clusters of about any type, in 924 different models, have these characteristics.
<!-- They are mostly `LEMMAREL` models or `FOC-WIN:3 + FOC-POS:lex` models. -->
<!-- NOTE add data based on all models --></p>
<!-- (ref:altocumulus) Example of Altocumulus cloud: inspiration on the left, plot example on the right. Picture by Bidgee - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6204153. -->

<!-- plotBasic(d[[altocumulus_example$lemma]]$medoidCoords[[altocumulus_example$model]]) -->

<p>These conditions are prompted by a low number of context words per token and a low type/token ratio of these context words.
<!-- TODO show logistic regression -->
These are groups of identical tokens, which isolates extremely strong collocations but erases all nuance, e.g. distances between groups and prototypicality of specific examples.</p>
<p>When these occur in Cumulonimbus configurations, we have a combination of very few context words per token (often only one) so that a small group with the exact same word(s) or, rarely, a few very similar ones (e.g. body parts in <em>hoekig</em>), stands out against all the rest… which itself might have inner bubbles.</p>
<p>This happens in very restrictive models where many tokens can be grouped together because they have identical vectors: they shared the few words that survived the thresholds.</p>
<p>These clusters often reveal the strongest context words, i.e. those that dominate in other clusters. They might match our expectations (like in <em>heet</em>, <em>herroepen</em>, <em>hemels</em>) or not (like in <em>staal</em> and <em>spot</em>). In the latter case, the problem is not too much noise but either not enough noise or wrong selection.</p>
<p>When there is not enough noise, the many identical tokens form tight and distinct clusters which we would rather group together, and tokens that don’t co-occur with the most powerful context words will be invisible. In that case, a slightly less restricted model might be more useful: in a way, noisy context words, often hopeless against the strong dominating context words, smooth the differences between the tokens to give us a more complex picture.</p>
<p>The wrong selection of context words means that context words that survive the restriction are not informative/useful, i.e. light verbs, determiners or prepositions. The same context words may become harmless noise in less restrictive models, but they might also keep their power if the less resilient context words are not strong enough. In that case, we might want to generate new models that exclude these particular context words, dependency relations, parts of speech, etc.</p>
<p>We might be tempted to consider these clusters idiomatic expressions: they match, visually, what we think a representation of idiomatic expressions would be like. Instead, they match groups of context words that occur very frequently in a very short distance (either in terms of bag-of-words or dependency relations) to the target. It tells us something about bigrams: about how often <em>niet</em> occurs close to <em>harden</em>; <em>van</em> to <em>staal</em>, <em>op</em> to <em>spot</em>, or <em>hangijzer</em> to <em>heet</em>. We still need to check which context words are responsible for the resulting structure and how they occur in the context.</p>

<p>Clouds come in many shapes. Like the cotton-like masses of droplets we see in our skies, the clusters of word occurrences generated by token-level distributional models may take different forms, depending on their density, their size and their distinctiveness. “Meaning is use,” “Differences in usage correlate with differences in meaning,” “You shall know a word by the company it keeps” and other such catchy slogans sound intuitively accurate, but they hide a wealth of complexity and variation. Like meaning, context is far from orderly, and a myriad of words with different characteristics interact to generate the variation we see in these clouds.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will try to make sense of the nephological topology, i.e. the variety of shapes that these clouds may take. For this purpose, we will classify HDBSCAN clusters mapped to t-SNE representations in a way that can help us understand what we see when we see a cloud. The starting point is the shape that a researcher sees in the scatterplot, which will be visually mapped to meteorological cloud types and further described in technical terms.</p>
