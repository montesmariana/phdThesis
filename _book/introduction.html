</h1>
<p>This dissertation concerns itself with the application of distributional methods,
developed within the field of Computational Linguistics (Section <a href="introduction.html#comp">1.1</a>),
to lexicological research, in particular the theoretical framework of Cognitive Semantics (Section <a href="introduction.html#cog">1.2</a>).
In addition, the study makes heavy use of visual analytics (Section <a href="introduction.html#viz">1.3</a>).</p>
<p>It is part of a larger project, Nephological Semantics, an even a longer research programme within QLVL (Section <a href="introduction.html#nephosem">1.4</a>).</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Distributional semantics and Computational Linguistics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comp"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Distributional semantics is a popular technique in Computational Linguistics, where it originated.
[Brief mention of references, but I will elaborate what it’s about in the first technical chapter.]
It relies on the Distributional Hypothesis, which states a correlation between the distributional properties
of words and their meaning (or rather, between differences in distribution and differences in meaning).</p>
<p>There are some differences between the use of this technique in Computational Linguistics and what we’ll show
in this thesis.</p>
<p>First, Computational Linguistics is typically task-oriented, and tests its models by comparing their
results to benchmarks, or gold standards [reference to some of them]. In contrast, we will
take manual annotation as a guideline, but not as a ground truth, and we are more interested in
learning what the models can tell us about the behaviour of words and in <em>how</em> models differ than
in their accuracy. [Admittedly, this is in part because there is no best model.]</p>
<p>Second, their distributional models mostly work at type-level and with word forms as units,
whereas we will look into token-level models with lemmas as units.
Of course, there is work at token-level in computational linguistics (as I will describe in the first chapter)
but it is not as popular as the type level. A more recent exception is BERT and family.</p>
<p>Third, since the advent of prediction-based models [Mikolov et al 2013…], word embeddings have become
increasingly popular; a number of papers have compared the performance of these and count-based models,
with different results, but in practice, neural networks are the norm in NLP. For these studies, we
looked into count-based model as a more transparent method, i.e. one in which we can trace the similarities
between tokens to the words that co-occur with them and their type-level similarity.
As the rest of the dissertation will show, the models are not necessarily as transparent as we thought they would be,
but that intuition was still the reasoning behind the preference for count-based models.</p>
<p>[Can I equate Computational Linguistics and NLP?]</p>

<div id="cog" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Distributional semantics and Cognitive Semantics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cog"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>[For the computational audience?]</p>
<p>Cognitive Linguistics is a theoretical framework characterized by (among other principles) an emphasis on meaning
(everything can be meaningful), the notion of fuzzy and prototypical categories and an usage-based approach.
[Bunch of references!]</p>
<p>These three cornerstones inform our study of distributional models in this dissertation.</p>
<p>First, given that the Distributional Hypothesis that underlies the methodology suggests a correlation between
distributional differences and semantic differences, what <em>kind</em> of semantic differences are at play?
Can we model different semantic dimensions with different distributional properties?
What kind of semantic phenomena (specialization, generalization, metaphor, metonymy… or even animacy, concreteness) can be modelled?
[This from a semasiological point of view; refer to onomasiological and lectometric studies too :) ]</p>
<p>Second, the notion of fuzzy and prototypical categories underlies a sceptical perspective towards the existence of senses
as discrete categories [more references] and encourages us to pursue a mechanism that can represent semasiological structure
in a non concrete way. To a certain degree, we need discrete entities to talk about them, we need to classify things,
and both the sense annotation and the use of clustering algorithms respond to such needs. But we don’t take them as a norm; instead,
we embrace the presence of noise, of degrees of membership, of partial overlap between solutions and general tendencies.
The full dissertation should be read in this light.</p>
<p>Third, the usage-based approach is easily mapped into this bottom-up, empirical, quantitative methodology,
within an already established trend in Cognitive Linguistics [references!]. With a few exceptions (we’ll see),
all the examples will be (randomly?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;I like this idea, because it’s (1) more honest and (2) fast, but might not return the best illustrations&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a>) extracted from the samples taken for the case studies. The arguments exposed in this
dissertation are backed up by the data used (which are available in The Cloud) and the specific analyses performed,
which also means that their generalization power is limited to that data and analyses.
Given that the results don’t <em>look</em> like they would be specific to this corpus (not in terms of the concrete descriptions of the lemmas,
but the methodological and theoretical generalizations), it is likely that they apply to other forms as well, but of course,
it’s an empirical question :)</p>

<p>Brief introduction of the motivation and rationale of the visualization tools (which will get their own chapter.)</p>
<!-- In order to explore the non discrete organization of attestations in the semantic space, -->
<!-- we can combine dimensionality reduction techniques with a graphic representation to visualize them -->
<!-- as points on a 2-dimensional space. While spatial distances represent distributional similarities, -->
<!-- colour-coding can represent the mapping of manually annotated senses, lects and clustering solutions. -->
<!-- More importantly, the visual tools developed within our research team and used for this project can also let us explore the -->
<!-- plots interactively, checking the actual contexts, finding the relative distances of points across different models, -->
<!-- and retrieving the context words responsible for the organization. -->

<p>Brief history and description of the project, how it brings the three points above together,
and what this PhD shares with previous PhD’s/publications within the project or what holes it fills.
For this I still have to reread the project description, Stefano’s subsection on his PhD and your Chapter 1 (any other suggestions?).</p>

<p>The rest of the dissertation will consist of three main parts.
The first part will focus on the methodological procedure and choices taken in this study:
the workflow to create vector space models (including an introduction to distributional semantics),
the visualization tool and clustering algorithms, and the selection of a dataset, its annotation, parameter settings, etc. (Not necessarily in that order.)
The second part will focus on the most important findings from the study [i.e. three main points].
The third (and less substantial?) part will round up the dissertation with a general practical guide (tips, tricks and warnings),
suggestions for further research and a conclusion. [Whether this amounts to one or two chapters, I’ll still have to see.]
