# (PART) Visualization tool {-}

# An interface to the world of clouds

In this and the following chapters, we will go through the steps needed to obtain "clouds" from corpora and how to explore them in the visualization tool developed within the Nephological Semantics project. It was originally created by [Thomas Wielfart](https://github.com/tokenclouds/tokenclouds.github.io),
using [D3](https://d3js.org), a popular Javascript library for data-driven visualization, and then further developed by me, culminating in the [present version](https://github.com/qlvl/NephoVis) [@montes.qlvl_2021].

This section will include the technical description of the workflow, as it pertains
to the tool itself and to the processing work made before (the Python module, other
Python and R functions), and a sort of manual of how it's used.

<!-- TODO short introduction of the outline of this PART -->

Visual analytics aims to integrate statistical data analysis with techniques from information visualization so that human analysts can recognize, interpret and reason about the statistical patterns that the data analysis reveals [@card.etal_1999]. Importantly, a visual analytics approach offers a manipulable, interactive visualization that, unlike static diagrams, enables the exploration of a space of parameter values and modeling outputs.
